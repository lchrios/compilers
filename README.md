# Repo for Compilers class

This contains, inside the 'project' folder the 'parser.py' file.
This file should be run and will read the input path or the 'input.txt' file by default.
Then it should generate a compiled version of the code in the 'output.txt' file.

Were you to run the compiler with a custom input use as follows:
```bash
$> python parser.py -f <filename> | --file <filename>
```
